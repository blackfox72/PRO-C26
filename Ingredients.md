Granny Smith – Green and tart, Granny Smith apples have wonderful flavor, but they they often lose their shape and turn mushy when cooked. So use no more than 2 Grannies in your pie, and combine with other varieties.
Jonagold – A cross between a Golden Delicious and a Jonathan, Jonagolds have a lovely aromatic flavor, they’re both sweet and sharp, and they hold their shape with baking.
Fuji – Crisp, firm, juicy, balance of sweet and tart, holds its shape in baking
Golden Delicious – Yellow and sweet, holds its shape after baking
Braeburn – Sweet and crisp, bakes up firm and juicy
Cortland – Juicy and tart, relatively soft, great all purpose apple for baking

Avoid Red Delicious apples for pies, they don’t cook well.
